## Systemic Dimensional Model of Cyberprofiling

I'm excited to announce that you can now download an improved version of the Python program for systemic dimensional cyberprofiling. This updated version not only implements the core functionalities discussed in [previous blog posts](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-cyberprofiling-social-networks-systemic-model-edwin-pe%C3%B1uela-hcr7e/?trackingId=DBl9twegQU21%2BhSemikf4w%3D%3D) but also includes sample data to help you emulate the program’s behavior and better understand how it works.

## What’s New in the Improved Version?
### Sample Data Included:

The improved program comes with preloaded sample data that represents different user profiles and network positions. This data allows you to simulate various scenarios and see how the program calculates profiles, influence, and total impact.

### Emulate the Program’s Behavior:

By running the program with the provided sample data, you can observe how different inputs affect the outputs. This will help you grasp the nuances of the model and how each dimension, weight, and network metric contributes to the final analysis.

### Automated Analysis Report:

The program has been enhanced to generate an automated analysis report. After processing the sample data `or any data you input`, the program outputs a detailed document that summarizes the findings, including user profiles, influence scores, and total network impact.
This report is generated in a structured format, making it easy to interpret and use for further analysis or presentations.

## How to Use the Improved Program?

### Download and Install:

You can download the improved program from the link provided below. Make sure to follow the installation instructions included in the package.

### Run the Program with Sample Data:

Once installed, simply run the program using the provided sample data to see how it operates. The sample data is designed to cover a range of scenarios, allowing you to explore the model's capabilities.

### Generate Your Own Analysis:

You can also input your own data into the program. Whether you’re analyzing real-world data or creating hypothetical scenarios, the program will process it and generate a comprehensive analysis report.

### Why Use the Improved Version?
This version of the program is perfect for researchers, data scientists, and cybersecurity analysts who want to:

- Understand the practical application of the systemic dimensional cyberprofiling model.
- Experiment with different scenarios to see how changes in user profiles or network structures affect the results.
- Automatically generate reports that can be used for decision-making or further research.

> By including sample data and report generation, this improved version of the program not only serves as a powerful analytical tool but also as an educational resource to deepen your understanding of advanced cyberprofiling techniques.
